# Java Basics

A collection of foundational Java programs covering essential programming concepts, number theory, and simple algorithms.  
This repository is intended for beginners and intermediate learners to strengthen their Java programming skills.

## 📁 Project Overview

The project is organized into multiple standalone Java programs focusing on:

- **Basic Mathematical Computations**  
  (e.g., Prime Numbers, Factorial, Strong Numbers, Single Digit Sum)
- **Number System Conversions**  
  (e.g., Binary to Decimal, Decimal to Binary)
- **Control Structures and Functions**  
  (e.g., Function Overloading, Palindrome Checking)
- **Simple Algorithmic Problems**  
  (e.g., Array Manipulation, Loops, Recursion)

Each file contains a focused solution with clean, readable code and inline comments for better understanding.
